<h1>Orbit: Lightweight jQuery Slider</h1>
<p>Orbit is a jQuery slider developed by ZURB. The plugin is lightweight(4KB), easy to implement and has a good set of features. Learn more about the plugin on the playground page here: <a href="http://www.zurb.com/playground/orbit-jquery-image-slider">http://www.zurb.com/playground/orbit-jquery-image-slider</a></p>

<p><strong>Note: This version of Orbit has been deprecated and will no longer be developed or supported. For the most recent code, check out the responsive version of Orbit included in <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a>, our rapid prototyping and production framework.</p>

<h3>Feature Request List</h3>
<p>Below are the features that have been requested or that we have seen an opportunity for and are going to try to tackle in future iterations of the plugin (in no particular order). These will, if implemented, be added to the plugin as part of Foundation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Custom data attribute implementation (similar to our Reveal plugin)</li>
<li>Create solid fix for positioning the initial Orbit container (since it gets wrapped and positioning gets broken without redundant CSS)</li>
<li>Continue browser testing and improving the initial load</li>
<li>Improve comment styles to be more flexible</li>
</ul>
